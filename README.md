# OpenAI_Function_Calling
This repository contains functionality to make OpenAI responses more domain-specific.

## Prompt Engineering :
1. Prompt engineering is a powerful technique that enables users to shape the behavior and output of AI models.
2. LLM (Large Language Models) help perform tasks that are not part of their pre-training.

## Function calling in OpenAI :
1. Create chatbots that answer questions by calling external tools (e.g., like ChatGPT Plugins).
2. Convert natural language into API calls or database queries.
3. Extract structured data from text

##Task : Develop a solution using Function calling.
1. Design a prompt that analyzes the user input and provides a response indicating whether the question belongs to Mathematics, Science, or none of the above.
2. Design a function that utilizes function calling to generate the subject metadata using OpenAI LLM.
3. Modify your response so that if the question pertains to Mathematics or Science, it will return "You are not authorized to ask this question." Otherwise, it will function as it did previously.
